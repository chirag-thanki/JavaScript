      <p>Q-1. What is JavaScript. How to use it?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            A. JavaScript is a powerful programming language primarily used to
            create interactive features on web pages. It’s one of the core
            technologies of the web, alongside HTML and CSS1. With JavaScript,
            you can implement dynamic content updates, control multimedia,
            animate images, and much more2.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          To use JavaScript, you can start by including it in your web pages
          through a &lt;script&gt; tag.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Q-2. How many type of Variable in JavaScript?</p>
      <p>
        In JavaScript, there are three main types of variables you can use:
        <br />
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          var: This is the oldest keyword used to declare a variable. It has
          function scope and can be re-declared and updated.
        </li>
        <li>
          let: Introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), let allows you to declare
          block-scoped variables that can be updated but not re-declared within
          the same scope.
        </li>
        <li>
          const: Also introduced in ES6, const is used to declare block-scoped
          variables that cannot be updated or re-declared. It’s important to
          note that while the variable itself is immutable, the contents of a
          const object can still be altered.
        </li>
      </ul>
